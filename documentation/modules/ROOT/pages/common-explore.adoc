The first time you access the web console, you will most likely be in the Administrator perspective. If you are also the Cluster Administrator, you will be presented with an overview of the whole Cluster status:

[#command_line_interface]
== Command Line Interface

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools
to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the
platform.  The OpenShift tools are a single executable written in the Go
programming language and is available for the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

You might already have the OpenShift CLI available on your environment. You can verify
it by running an `oc` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.6.9
Server Version: 4.6.4
Kubernetes Version: v1.19.0+9f84db3
----

If the `oc` doesn't exist or you have an older version of the OpenShift CLI, follow
the next sections to install or update the OpenShift CLI. Otherwise, skip to the
next lab.

[#download_openshift_cli]
=== Download CLI

From top right menu bar, click to the little white question mark icon, then click to *Command Line Tools*:

image::prerequisites_cli_links.png[Download CLI]


Scroll down to *oc - OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)*

[#download_and_install_openshift_cli_on_linux]
==== *Download and Install OpenShift CLI on Linux*


Once the file has been downloaded, you will need to extract the contents as it
is a compressed archive. I would suggest saving this file to the following
directories:

[source,bash]
----
~/OpenShift
----

Open up a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded the
file.  Once you are in the directory, enter in the following command:

CAUTION: The name of the oc packaged archive may vary. Adjust accordingly. For instance, if the file is not a zipped format (check using the 'file' command), you' ll want to omit the z-switch on the tar command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
tar zxvf oc-linux.tar.gz
----

The tar.gz file name needs to be replaced by the entire name that was downloaded in the previous step.

Now you can add the OpenShift CLI tools to your PATH.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
export PATH=$PATH:~/openShift
----

At this point, we should have the oc tool available for use. Let's test this
out by printing the version of the oc command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.6.9
Server Version: 4.6.4
Kubernetes Version: v1.19.0+9f84db3
----

If you get an error message, you have not updated your path correctly. If you
need help, raise your hand and the instructor will assist.

[#download_and_install_openshift_cli_on_mac]

----

The tar.gz file name needs to be replaced by the entire name that was downloaded in the previous step.

Now you can add the OpenShift CLI tools to your PATH.

==== *Download and Install OpenShift CLI on Mac OS X using HomeBrew*

If you have HomeBrew installed (www.brew.sh) you can install OpenShift CLI using brew:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
brew install openshift-cli
----

You may also want to enable CLI autocompletion (bash or zsh):
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
source <(oc completion bash)
source <(oc completion zsh)
----

To make CLI autocompletion persistent (bash or zsh) by adding a relevant line to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion.sh
oc completion bash > oc_zsh_completion.sh
 
source oc_bash_completion.sh
source oc_zsh_completion.sh
----

[#download_and_install_openshift_cli_on_windows]
==== *Download and Install OpenShift CLI on Windows*

The CLI for Windows is provided as a zip archive. Download and unzip the archive with a ZIP program and move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH. To check your PATH, open the Command Prompt and run:

[.console-input]
[source,shell,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
path
----

[#connect_to_the_cluster_with_cli]
=== Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI

Once your `oc` client is setup on your Workstation, you can connect to cluster and start working also with OpenShift CLI.

From Web Console overview, go to top-right menu bar and click to the dropdown menu containing your username, then click *Copy Login Command*:

image::prerequisites_copy_login_command.png[Copy Login Command]

Click on *Display Token* and copy the command under *Login with this token*:

Example:

[source,bash]
----
oc login --token=some_token --server=https://c104-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:32208
----

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Logged into "https://c104-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:32208" as "%USERNAME%" using the token provided.

You have access to 68 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".

[#working_with_proxies]
==== Working with proxies
It might happen that you're behind a corporate proxy to access the internet. In this case, you'll need to set
some additional environment variables for the oc command line to work.

**Windows:**
Follow previous section's instructions on how to set an Environment Variable on Windows. The variables you'll need
to set are:

CAUTION: Replace the proxy server with the one for your environment/machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
https_proxy=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
----

**Mac OS X:**

CAUTION: Replace the proxy server with the one for your environment/machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
export https_proxy=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
----

**Linux:**

CAUTION: Replace the proxy server with the one for your environment/machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
export https_proxy=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
----

[NOTE]
====
If the proxy is secured, make sure to use the following URL pattern, replacing the contents with the
appropriate values:

export https_proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSOWRD@proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/

__Special Characters__: If your password contains special characters, you must replace them with ASCII codes, for example the at sign @ must be replaced by the %40 code, e.g. p@ssword = p%40ssword.
